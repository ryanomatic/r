# Medievia96
This is the Medievia96 project - open source version of Medievia's code from 1996.
See lib/motd.txt for more info on what has been changed/added.

# Development
If you'd like to contribute to this project, you can clone this repository and set
up a local instance of the game for development and testing. Create a feature
branch, make your changes, commit, push, and make a pull request.

The game is currently running on Ubuntu 16 x86. Building an x64 version on a newer
version of Linux should also be possible.

Ubuntu 16 x86: https://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-16.04.6-desktop-i386.iso

Getting it up and running is basically:
```
git clone git@github.com:medievia96/medievia96.git
cd medievia96/src
make
./medievia_online
```

Ignore the billions of warnings. Log in as 'vryce', password 'vryce123'.
Use the 'wizhelp' command to see what god commands are available.

If you need help with setting it up, or have any questions, log on to medievia96.com
and telepath or mudmail Vryce. I probably won't be monitoring the Issues on GitHub, but
you can submit one there I guess.

# Disclaimer
Please remember that I did not write the vast majority of this code. I've done what
I can to clean it up but there are definitely bugs... Lurking about.
